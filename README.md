This is a repo of core implementation of our research "FRADE: Forgery-aware Audio-distilled Multimodal Learning for Deepfake Detection" (ACM MM 2024, Poster)
  
## Dataset Pipeline
  The pipeline is identical to the RealForensics' pipeline: [Link](https://github.com/ahaliassos/RealForensics/tree/main/stage1/data). Note: The augmented transformations of Realforensics are not involved in our model training.
